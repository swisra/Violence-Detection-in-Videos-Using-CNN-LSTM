# Violence-Detection-in-Videos-Using-CNN-LSTM
## Project Overview  
This project aims to develop an AI-based system for detecting violent activities in videos using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The system is designed to analyze video frames, extract spatial and temporal features, and classify whether a scene contains violent actions.

##  Technologies Used  
**MobileNet (CNN)** – for spatial feature extraction  
**LSTM** – for temporal sequence learning  
**TensorFlow & Keras** – deep learning framework  
**OpenCV** – for video processing  
**Google Colab** – for model training  
**VS Code** – for implementation & testing

## 🛠️ How It Works  
**1-Feature Extraction** 📸: MobileNet extracts key features from each video frame.  
**2-Temporal Analysis** ⏳: LSTM captures motion patterns over sequential frames.  
**3-Prediction** 🎯: The model classifies each scene as **violent or non-violent**.
