# Violence-Detection-in-Videos-Using-CNN-LSTM
This project aims to develop an AI-based system for detecting violent activities in videos using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The system is designed to analyze video frames, extract spatial and temporal features, and classify whether a scene contains violent actions.
